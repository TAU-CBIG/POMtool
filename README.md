# POM tool

## Description
This is CLI-tool to create population of model and calibrate your model. It can calculate biomarkers, and calibrate either your model or your population based on those parameters.

## Using
Currently, just clone the repository and run:
```
./main.py run --config my_config.yaml
```

Look at example files to create your own config. First make sure you are able to run your model in command line. Then insert those instruction over one of example configs available.

## Future
* More ways to use the tool will be made available as the project progresses
* This documentation will be made better
* More examples will be provided, and some example projects will be made public for best practices
* Some thoughts can also be found from roadmap
